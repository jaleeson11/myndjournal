					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>
						Mynd Journal is a two part journaling app designed to help you develop new ways of relating to negative thoughts and 
						to experience a greater feeling of gratitude and thanks towards life. The skills that you will learn in the journaling
						process have been shown to help with mood problems associated with anxiety-related disorders and even have health benefits
						such as reducing stress. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The ideas in Mynd Journal come from cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), 
						one of today's most effective forms of psychotherapy. The cognitive model describes how peopleâ€™s perceptions of, or spontaneous
						thoughts about situations influence their emotional, behavioural (and often physiological) reactions.
