            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Mynd Journal is a two part journaling app designed to help you develop new ways of relating to negative thoughts and 
            to experience a greater feeling of gratitude and thanks towards life. The skills that you will learn in the journaling
            process have been shown to help with mood problems associated with anxiety-related disorders and even have health benefits
            such as reducing stress. 
            </p>
            <p>The ideas in Mynd Journal come from cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), 
            one of today's most effective forms of psychotherapy. The cognitive model describes how peopleâ€™s perceptions of, or spontaneous
            thoughts about situations influence their emotional, behavioural (and often physiological) reactions.
